# AI Chatbot using NLP & TensorFlow

An intelligent chatbot built with **Python**, **TensorFlow**, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a simple conversational AI capable of understanding user intent and generating relevant responses.

## ✨ Features
- Intent recognition using custom-trained LSTM model
- Clean, structured NLP pipeline (tokenization, stemming, vectorization)
- FastAPI-powered backend for real-time chatbot responses
- Easy to train and customize with new intents
- Deployment-ready for Render, Hugging Face Spaces, or local Docker

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- Python 3.10+
- TensorFlow
- scikit-learn
- FastAPI
- Jupyter Notebooks
- JSON (for intent training data)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zig-Tutorials/ai-chatbot-nlp.git
cd ai-chatbot-nlp
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r app/requirements.txt
```

### 3. Train the model
Open `notebooks/training.ipynb` and run all cells to train and save the model.

### 4. Run the FastAPI server
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Then go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` to test your chatbot API.
